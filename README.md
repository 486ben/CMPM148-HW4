<h1>Basckground</h1>

Your team had been presented with a map that promised to lead you to a treasure beyond your wildest dreams. But as the leader of the group, you couldn't help but feel skeptical about the whole thing. Something about the map didn't sit right with you, and you were wary of the potential traps or hidden dangers that may lie ahead.

Despite your reservations, your team was eager to follow the map to the treasure. They were convinced that this was their chance to strike it rich and live the life of their dreams. You knew that you couldn't stop them, but you also knew that it was your responsibility to ensure their safety.

As you made your way through the dense jungle, following the map's instructions, you couldn't shake the feeling that you were being watched. You urged your team to be cautious, warning them of the potential dangers that may be lurking around every corner.

Your caution proved to be well-founded when you stumbled upon a hidden temple deep in the heart of the jungle. The temple was overgrown with vines and covered in moss, and you could sense that it had been abandoned for centuries.

But as you and your team began to explore the temple, you quickly realized that it was far from abandoned. Traps and pitfalls lay around every corner, and you could feel the eyes of unseen watchers following your every move.

It was a harrowing experience, navigating the treacherous temple, but you and your team managed to emerge unscathed. When you finally reached the treasure room, you were relieved to find that the treasure was indeed real. But even as you reveled in your success, you couldn't help but feel grateful that you had been cautious and skeptical throughout the journey.

For you, the true treasure wasn't the gold or the jewels, but the safety and well-being of your team. And you knew that if it wasn't for your skepticism and caution, the journey could have ended very differently.
